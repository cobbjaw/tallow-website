# Tallow: the Making

The website is meant to drum up interest about an upcoming children's book. The website will include information about the author and the illustrator. Below that, a short section telling what the subjects and main characters in the book. Finally, the website offers a pop-up to sign up for a newsletter to stay informed on the project.

## Getting Started
Website works best on Chrome or Firefox. Most featues work responsively on Internet Explorer except the paragraphs don't separate into columns.

## Prerequisites
Having Chrome or Firebox browsers. 

##Built With
html, css, js
Bootstrap- for Newsletter modal

##Javascript functions
The custom javascript intergrates with the bootstrap modal. There are two custom functions in the infoForm.js file: 

1) When "Other" radio button is clicked, removes the hidden class from the html class 'otherInput' revealing an input box. 

2) when any other radio button is clicked, pushes the hidden class back to 'otherInput' and places empty string to erase any characters.

3) thanks the viewer for signing up for the newsletter when they click "Save Changes" using ALERT.

##
The modal isn't responsive. It doesn't look correct on the mobile approach. It will take some messing around with Bootstrap, but I wanted to go ahead and submit the assignment as is.
